Hey there! Welcome to the TeslaKitty organization on GitHub! We're a bunch of people who love building cool things together, and we're excited to share our projects with you.

## Our Fun Projects! 😺

Here are some of the things we've been working on:

* **Catchat**: This is a chat app where you can talk to other people who like the same things you do! You can find it [here](https://catchat-meow.netlify.app/).
* **TeslaKitty**: This is our main website! It's like our clubhouse on the internet, where you can learn all about our group and our projects. Check it out [here](https://teslakitty.netlify.app/).
* **Catchat App**: This is the Catchat Android app. Check it out [here](https://github.com/teslakitty/catchat-android/).

## Want to Help? You Can! 🌟

We'd love for you to help us make our projects even better! You can help by:

* Telling us if you find any bugs (little problems) or if you have ideas for new features (cool things we could add).
* If you know how to code, you can even help us write the code!
* To learn how to help, check out our "contribution guidelines" (it's like a rulebook for helping) [here](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
